### The Software

The Software is a free download that allows users to locally run a software application that is a specially designed virtual machine capable of locally loading and running “front end” components (“Components”) for blockchain based application layer protocols on any L1 or L2 blockchain. The code for these Components can be viewed via the Software, similar to viewing a smart contract in Etherscan. You acknowledge and agree that Company has no control over any blockchain, protocol, smart contract, or blockchain-based applications. Any interaction with a Component or blockchain based application layer protocol is a locally run instance by the user and not known to or otherwise under the control of Company.
THE SOFTWARE DOES NOT ENABLE OR FACILITATE ANY ASPECT OF BLOCKCHAIN BASED DIGITAL ASSET TRANSACTIONS. THE SOFTWARE MERELY PROVIDES A SET OF TOOLS FOR USERS TO LOCALLY VIEW AND INTERACT WITH CODE THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO BLOCKCHAIN BASED NETWORKS. THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF INFORMATION PRESENTED BY THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER IN CONNECTION WITH BLOCKCHAIN-BASED COMPONENTS OR OTHERWISE, IS NOT GUARANTEED BY US.
COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE CUSTODY OVER YOUR ASSETS OR ACCESS TO YOUR PRIVATE KEY AND CANNOT INITIATE A TRANSFER OF DIGITAL ASSETS OR OTHERWISE ACCESS YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS.
THE SOFTWARE IS NOT A BROKER OR INTERMEDIARY AND IS IN NO WAY YOUR AGENT, ADVISOR, OR CUSTODIAN, AND WE DO NOT HAVE A FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP OR OBLIGATION TO YOU REGARDING ANY OTHER DECISIONS OR ACTIVITIES THAT YOU EFFECT WHEN USING A DIGITAL ASSET WALLET TO INTERACT WITH ANY BLOCKCHAIN PROTOCOL.
